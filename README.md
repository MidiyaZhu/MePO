# MePO
In this work, we introduce **MePO**, a lightweight, locally deployable prompt optimization model trained under a pattern-guided preference framework. 

The dataset can be found in [zixiaozhu/MePO](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zixiaozhu/MePO/tree/main) and model will be released in huggingface soon.
